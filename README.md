OLEDs are high contrast displays that are useful for a variety of electronic projects. This project is a small board for these [Newhaven OLED modules](http://www.newhavendisplay.com/oled-slim-character-oleds-c-119_825.html). It allows these displays to work easily with most microcontroller boards using the I²C interface. The board and display operates on any voltage between 3.3 and 5 volts and has two Grove type I²C connectors on it.

A demo program and software library are available for Arduino and Particle microcontroller boards. This library has many functions to make using these displays easy.

Bare PC boards are available from OSH Park.
